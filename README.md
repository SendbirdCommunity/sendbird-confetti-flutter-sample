# sendbird-confetti-flutter-sample

## Introduction
This is a sample application showing how to trigger special effects with [Sendbird](https://sendbird.com)'s Flutter SDK, [DashChat 2](https://pub.dev/packages/dash_chat_2), and [Confetti](https://pub.dev/packages/confetti).

## Requirements
- Dart 2.14.0+
- Flutter 2.5.0+


## Setup
See [Flutter install instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) for your platform and preferred IDE.

Run the `flutter pub get` CLI command to update packages before running.

## Running
Once Flutter has been setup, check if there are any simulators/emulators/devices available to run on with:
`flutter devices`

Which will output something similar to:
```
iPhone 12 mini (mobile)                      • 487C50F3-5F34-4D7E-85BB-911977A813D3 • ios
Chrome (web)                                 • chrome                               • web-javascript
```

Execute `flutter run -d <device_id>` to run the app on a given device (ie `flutter run -d FB`)

The first screen should then appear:
